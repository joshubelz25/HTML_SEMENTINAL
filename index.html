            <p>Fruits are important sources of vitamins and carbohydrates like fiber and sugar. They are low in calories and naturally sweet. Fruits and their juices are good sources of water, too. Different fruits contain different vitamins, so it is important to eat a variety of fruits. Mangoes, papayas, melons and citrus fruits, like oranges and grapefruit, are high in vitamin C. Cantaloupe, apricots, peaches, and nectarines are sources of vitamin A.Whole fruits like apples and grapes contain more fiber than fruit juices and sauces, like applesauce and grape juice. Dried fruits like figs, prunes and raisins are good sources of fiber, too. Canned fruits packed in syrup have a lot of added sugar. They are higher in calories than fresh fruits. When you shop for canned fruits, look for fruit that is packed in juice instead of syrup.</p>

            <h2>FRUIT and more friut</h2>
            <p>Fruits are beautiful gift of nature having many varieties and many different tastes. They have a great storage of energy because they are rich in vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates and many other energetic compounds. Fruits also have remedy for many diseases and their regular use keep us away from being sick, so fruits are also called natural medicines.There are many types of fruits having different varieties and varying taste, but my favorite one is “Mango”, the king of fruits due to its yummy taste and juicy pulp. Its sweet taste dominates over all tastes. Mango is also the national fruit of India, and this yummy fruit is native to India, Pakistan and Philippine. Especially India and Pakistan have many varieties and thousands of mango orchards. Mango has different varieties depending upon its origin, size, and taste, for example Alampur Baneshan , Alphonso, Bombay, Dasheri, Langra etc. Every variety has different specification and varies in colors also. Mangoes are picked up unripe from the trees and then packed into the boxes along with ethylene which is a plant ripening hormone. After some period of time, mangoes get ripe by the ethylene gas. But unripe, immature mangoes are also very tasty and useful.</p>
